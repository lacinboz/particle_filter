# Particle Filter Project

This repository contains two particle filter implementations for tracking indistinguishable objects in noisy environments:

-  `oneparticlefilter.ipynb`: A separate particle filter per ball assuming known ID association.
-  `multimodalparticlefilter.ipynb`: A single particle filter using multimodal estimation and clustering to handle indistinguishable balls.

 Includes sensor dropout simulation, parabolic motion, and GIF-based animation output.

## Usage
Open the corresponding notebook in Jupyter and run cell-by-cell.

## Files
- `particle_filter_animation.gif`: Animated visualization of the results.
- `README_multimodalparticlefilter.md`: Details for multimodal version.
- `README_oneparticlefilter.md`: Details for per-ball version.
